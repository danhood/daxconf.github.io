                          Data-driven applications are the norm in business,
                          industry, and our personal lives. These applications
                          increasingly engage various existing and emerging
                          technologies, such as Virtual Reality, Augmented
                          Reality, Autonomous Systems, Computer Vision, Digital
                          Twins, Blockchain, Internet of Things, and more. The
                          addition of AI to the data process flows enables the
                          applications to be more than data-driven, but become
                          insights-driven, intelligent, smart, and
                          value-oriented. The future of AI will thus focus on
                          value creation at the convergence of emerging
                          technologies.

                          As robots move from factories into human-centric
                          spaces, it becomes progressively harder for
                          programmers to predict what environments and
                          interactions they will need to be able to handle.
                          Letting robots learn from end users via natural
                          language is an intuitive, versatile approach to
                          handling novel situations robustly. The focus of this
                          talk is on how robots can learn to understand language
                          about the noisy physical world from a combination of
                          sensor data and interactions with people. I will also
                          discuss the role of speech understanding in grounded
                          language learning.

                          All levels of the Maryland government are working to
                          utilize big data to help solve big government
                          problems. The state and Baltimore City have both
                          recently instituted Chief Data Officers to develop,
                          maintain, utilize, and smartly disseminate government
                          data sets. The first step to reliable data is data
                          governance. Join Baltimore City CDO Justin Elszasz and
                          Maryland State CDO Patrick McLoughlin as they outline
                          the process, benefits, and plans they are currently
                          developing to keep Maryland data safe and accessible.

                          We are all at DAX because we're trying to solve the
                          same problem: There is SO much data out there and not
                          enough humans to process it. We need help, and that
                          involves automation, which leads me to the next
                          challenge we’re all trying to overcome: How do we
                          trust the automation and more importantly how do we
                          trust implementing the outputs of it? Many are leaning
                          into xAI, Trusted AI or Ethical AI as key to the
                          adoption of our work. Let’s take it one step further
                          and discuss the importance of ART in our work. As
                          humans, we have influence over our data and we need to
                          take this power seriously in order to solve our data
                          problems collaboratively and transparently.
